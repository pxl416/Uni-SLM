# Uni-SLM: Unified Sign Language Model

> **Unified Sign Language Model for Multi-Task Understanding and Generation**

---

## üåç Overview

**Uni-SLM** is a unified framework for **sign language understanding** that integrates multiple core tasks within a single model:

- **Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)**  
- **Sign Language Retrieval (Text‚ÜîVideo)**  
- **Sign Language Translation (SLT)**  
- (Future) **Segmentation & Generation**

The framework aims to share a **common multimodal encoder** (RGB, Pose, and Text) and support **task-specific heads** for diverse downstream tasks, following a unified **Adaptive Information Bottleneck (AdaIB)** optimization principle.
